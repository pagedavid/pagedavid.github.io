![Goat]({{relative}}/assets/goat.png){:class="float-right"}I am a Philadelphia-based full-stack web developer. I enjoy learning new things, coming up with ideas, solving problems, and explaining tech stuff to non-tech people (just ask my mom).

I studied philosophy of religion at Oberlin College where my passion was journalism and the internet. I'm most proud of starting a successful independent online news organization that continued after I left.

After college, I pursued my interest for creating websites and have been working as a webmaster and freelance web designer.

Though most of my developmental experience has been in Wordpress, I've picked up experience in Linux server administration, graphic design, and video production.

I've taken courses in web design, programming, and databases, where I've developed my hacker ethos of if I don't know it, I'll learn it. I bring that mentality to all of my work, whether it's designing a system to record and live-stream events or configuring a friend's home network.

From my volunteer experience I've learned that everyone can (and wants to) have something meaningful to offer, and it's simply up to me to realize what that is and encourage it.
