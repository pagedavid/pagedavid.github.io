title: Making krutchfilm.com

This was the first real site I made for my brother's short film Krutch. It was one of two websites awarded at a film festival in Germany. The other was for a film by Roman Polansky. 

Anyway, it's really a basic site. I thought Wordpress would be overkill so I wrote a minimal PHP template system to just handle including the header. (I hadn't discovered static site builders yet...) I was the primary maintainer of the site for awhile so I was comfortable marking up HTML. My brother wanted to be able to maintain the list of upcoming shows on the homepage himself. I gave him a tutorial on what he needed to copy/paste and what to edit, and a version of the component like <h1>[TITLE]</h1> and he was good.

The only complicated thing the site does is emailing form submissions. I found a basic PHP script and modified it to fit the fields they wanted to collect for contacting and booking.
