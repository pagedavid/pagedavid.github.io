Three friends I know from highschool have a band and I had the idea for this website while sitting in on a practice. They all have an affinity for hard 70's rock and album design, so why not make them a site that navigates like one?

It's funny that this site I made for fun over a weekend demonstrates some of my best coding. It's a single page app that I wrote entirely in plain Javascript. I bet there's better ways I could have approached my methods, but it works.

The JS controls the audio player, resizes the site so the height and width always stay square (it's an album!), navigates the back/front covers and inside by setting display properties, and switches background images.

It's the first time I used the HTML5 audio element with custom controls. The autoplay functionality was important to script so the full album could be played like a record. There was debate over whether to show what track was actually playing, but the band sided with yes.

A member of the band sent me the images for the inside lyrics pages. Not long before I had read about background-blend modes and I was eager to use them on a website.

The title of their album was This Is How You Dance To Skirt. They liked my idea of using that as the URL and never actually saying the title on the site.

Anyway, it's a fun (and maybe clever?) little site.
