title: Making Stthomas.life
---
Every church knows that there is a category of people who go to church twice a year. Basically, they only care to know what time the services are on Christmas and Easter. Getting that information in front of them is a huge part of the communications during those seasons.

One way St. Thomas' does it is through a banner sign on their high-traffic street corner. There's too much going on to list everything so the sign naturally includes the church's URL. The thing is though, the St. Thomas' website is very large, and there's always been a question over its primary purpose: attract first-time visitors or serve current parishioners. The second thing is the URL itself. How many people are going to read and remember "stthomaswhitemarsh.org" on their morning commute?

The strategy I proposed was to create a landing page for these two events, and use one of the newer top level domains to get a shorter, and more memorable, URL. 

I designed the page mobile-first (naturally). It's integrated with Facebook and Twitter for easy sharing with friends. It's hosted on github for free. 

I suggested "stthomas.life" as the URL and it was approved. I know that many (if not all) people wouldn't recognize the newly released domains as things they should type into their browser. To counter this I made sure that in all printed material the "www" or "http://" be included.
