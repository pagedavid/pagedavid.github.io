My brother describes my webdesign aesthetic as "Shaker-minimal." Personally, I don't like over-designed sites and bloated code so that's what I did here. I guess it's kind of a "Brutalist" approach? Minus the intentional ugly/unusable.

I've worked with Jekyll and Middleman to design static sites in the past, and picked Jekyll for this one because I planned to host it on Github. (Woo free hosting!) I started off with the Minima theme and stripped the CSS. You can [see the source code here](https://github.com/pagedavid/pagedavid.github.io).

The line drawings I used I obtained from [Wikimedia Commons Pearson Scott Foresman Collection](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Pearson_Scott_Foresman_publisher), except for the bunny. I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to vectorize them and then resize them so they wouldn't blur at small sizes. I was surprised that collection didn't have a rabbit (they have a groundhog and horseshoe crab...) but I used [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to cut one out of [this image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Animals_competitors;_profit_and_loss_from_the_wild_four-footed_tenants_of_the_farm_(1911)_(18010401688).jpg).

As of this writing, there's still a little bit more I might do with the site structure. I figure I could add a site footer, and make the blog a bit more navigable with category pages. Other than that, I'm really happy with how the site looks and works. 

It's just about as me as I can get, and that's all I was going for here.
